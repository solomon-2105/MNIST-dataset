# MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition Project

This repo demonstrates how to train and evaluate a high-accuracy digit recognition model using TensorFlow, with both command-line and Streamlit-based web app interfaces , it achieved over 98% accuracy on the official MNIST test set using a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
