# MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition Project

This end-to-end machine learning repository demonstrates how to train, evaluate, and deploy a high-accuracy digit recognition model using TensorFlow, with both command-line and Streamlit-based web app interfaces , it achieved **over 98% accuracy** on the official MNIST test set using a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
